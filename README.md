# SuperMaproid

C project for 1st year of CS.

Basic videogame using SDL2 to learn basic data structures and their uses. 
Probably filled with basic mistakes and bad techniques (all source files and resources in root dir) since it was my 1st year, but I want to keep it as it is.

You will need SDL2 in order for it to run.
